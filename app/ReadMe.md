## How to run our project.
We recommend Pixel 4 API 30. This phone has google play support which is important to see the map.
You may need our API Key for Google Maps. It is: AIzaSyC-vXET_YKJrz1UisWeelIiHgRupySXyhM

## Beginners guide
Begin by running the program.
Select "New User? Click Me to Sign Up"
Fill out the appropriate fields and create your own user.
Then please log in.
You will then be on the feature 1 splash page. This page contains the Google Map with gym coordinates plotted.
From here click on a gym name and make a few reservations. This is feature 2. If the capacity is empty, you may ask to be reminded in lieu of making a reservation.
Then push the booking button, to navigate to feature 3, the booking page. This page will display what you have booked, and move outdated bookings into previous bookings if the day has passed.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
